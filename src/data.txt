it is no longer feasible or affordable to purchase the most capable multi mission platform and then limit its use to execute tailored mission areas or focus on specific threats as asymmetric threats continue to evolve so will traditional threats the navy must find affordable and adaptable ways to fill current and future warfighting gaps
a capable ship which meets the requirements for which it was designed
the ddg 1000 cannot perform area air defense specifically it cannot successfully employ the standard missile sm 2 sm 3 or sm 6 and is incapable of conducting ballistic missile defense although superior in littoral asw the ddg 1000 lower power sonar design is less effective in the blue water than ddg 51 capability ddg 1000s advanced gun system ags design provides enhanced naval fires support capability in the littorals with increased survivability however with the accelerated advancement of precision munitions and targeting excess fires capacity already exists from tactical aviation and organic usmc fires unfortunately the ddg 1000 design sacrifices capacity for increased capability in an area where navy already has and is projected to have sufficient capacity and capability
for four weeks between may and june we had decc officers on 24 hour call in the field to respond to resident odour complaints and to monitor contributing factors such as location and wind
during the course of our investigations we located one industry where the odour controls were not working correctly and we are now making sure that the company rectifies this
both of these businesses are co operating with decc staff to help eliminate any potential contributions they may be making towards rutherfords odour issues and thats a very positive outcome
we were able to analyse four samples from our odour capturing canisters used during the survey however none of these came from residential areas and with the exception of the samples obtained from hunter water corporations sewer system were in fact typical of busy roads
based on the diversity of complaints both in odour types and location we knew that this would not be a simple matter of finding one single source instead it is most likely a combination of processes from a combination of industries
hopefully by working with the industries in rutherford to ensure that the correct odour controls are in place we can eliminate the offensive smells as much as possible
just notice your breath repeatedly constantly start with a few minutes do it regularly daily everyday no days off if you miss a day dont ruminate too much just pick it up and start again keeping it regular is very important it will bring order and a restfulness to your life off of the cushion as it were
i would like to speak a moment about this concept of community as a meditator you are not alone you are not selfish because you take the time to notice your thoughts in fact you will come to see if you sit with any real regularity and commitment that your time sitting will alter maybe even transform your life with others in very beneficial harmonious ways i do not want to give you the impression that everything will be perfect and pleasant henceforward no this is not any humans reality that i have met and i have met the lowest and the highest of the caste no i just wanted to make certain that you heard the report from the front lines as it were that you are not alone ever never no how
there is nothin like that crack of the bat at the park it is probably my favorite sound of the park its not the same on broadcast no matter what kind of system you put it through ambience echo cracker jacks i dont care if i ever get back
yah i picked this white one up last year i wear it when i think they are going to win i wear the grey when they are destined to lose i think ill have to wear the grey one more
so do you find you get more comments from people when you were either color
yah definetly the white one gets more guys staring at me those boys sneer occasionally at the grey one but the white one is more noticeable much more piratey looking if they ever drop the price on em or do another one hey maybe you and viv could do one with maybe less quality ah but youd probably go in the other direction and line em with sensors well maybe all i am saying is they could take off as a weird trend
exactly ok so what are your top ten fenway sounds today
in no particular order no wait i think i can order them
common ma can i get a coffee i am too old enough to drink
hey braid what can you tell me about the whereabouts of a guy named rockrock ring any bells
ya rockrock viv must have let on to you about the package i received the other day it was dropped in at her uncles place im not certain how anyone knew we were there but it was clearly for me for us and there was a picture the picture was of cocoa and me taken about a month ago
compro what no we were just having a snack down by the harbor
i mean anything technologically compromising like maybe how did that photo get taken without either of you knowing it was being taken that kind of compromising
oh yah well since you put it that way yes very compromising
oh in that instance yah i think i know who this rockrock person maybe
police are of the opinion that although the options of avos and the like are being pursued it will not deter those persons residing in willow drive from harassing the couple
police are fearful that the violence may get out of hand and the best way to avoid this is through relocation

vet tenants more thoroughly and not use our area as a dumping ground for troublemakers
but it wasnt like that for us last christmas when all my kids presents were broken or stolen and our house was damaged by fire
we had been out on christmas day returning to find our house had been trashed
we had been inside for only a few minutes before people began throwing bricks at the building
i ran out with my 18 month old baby in my arms my other children following
the taxi driver waiting for us was astonished at what was happening
our families are all safe now and i want nothing from anybody
but i feel i must speak up now or i will have it on my conscience forever if i keep quiet and someone is killed in willow drive
living there can be a nightmare and i feel so sorry for people who still live with all those troubles
i was targeted because i am against drugs so i became the worst person in the world to many people there
no one in the street will talk to police because they are so frightened
people are fighting all over the place and it is getting out of hand
the department of housing is putting bad people in here without checking on their past history
my idea of hell is being photographed so maybe we can consider this my therapy session but im really looking forward to seeing how the artists view me because hopefully theyll be kinder to me than i am on myself and thats part of the therapy
ive been listening to carol on the radio for years but ive never seen her so this has been a great experience
because when you listen to someone on the radio for quite some time you can get a preconceived idea of what the face on the end of that voice may look like
one of the things that makes it okay is that as opposed to being photographed youre being captured by someone else the only view of a photograph is the one you put on it yourself so this is my opportunity to see what other people see
also how often in life do you get to do something like this my reaction to the whole thing has been yes then no yes then no but its a great privilege i mean when was the last time someone rang up and said hey can i paint your head
and for people who have life long self esteem problems i think something like this helps even if they turn you inside out and flip you on your head
this is why i work in radio and not television
participants involved in this activity can look back proudly on their achievements knowing that their contribution created ongoing benefit to their community through assisting with the presentation and profile of a major tourist attraction of the hunter
get some training interact with other people and build their self esteem
the gaol is a state icon and the work for the dole project has not only been good for the participants in terms of giving them useful trade skills but its made an enormous contribution to the site
this course is slightly different its going to have a little more emphasis on problem solving and negotiation skills
it will give men better skills and strategies for resolving conflict so it doesnt escalate into something else
its for men in close domestic relationships through to men having problems in their workplace unemployed to professional people
younger men are more open to it i think its happening slowly
women are encouraged to talk about their feelings where men arent
this workshop will help men to identify and acknowledge what their feelings are
it was a bit of a surprise it just arrived
its a difficult thing for disability business services to market to the community because were so diverse and the community dont really have an understanding of what we do
the funding is a good recognition from the government that this is a worthwhile venture
disability services like mai wel need to market themselves and sometimes they have a limited capacity to do so
this is a one off grant to up their activity on the marketing side
this of course will hopefully grow their business and provide greater opportunities for them to expand
theres nothing more important in disability services than providing the challenge and opportunity to work in mainstream australia
the staff are very excited about going in as are the residents and the families
it brings us right up and into the 21st century
benhome provides a wonderful service to the local community and this further enhances what theyre able to do
all governments are appreciative of not for profit organisations like the one here helping to engage the local community in the financial support of these facilities
there shouldnt be any greater priority for government than to take care of elderly australians those who have contributed so much to the development of the nation
weve got a rapidly ageing population so governments generally are going to have to look in the future at investing more into aged care facilities
weve got an intergenerational challenge ahead of us to support older australians
it the care of elderly australians has to be a big focus theres no doubt that greater investments are required
when i started here 11 years ago we didnt have a call for it
about eight years ago it was identified and we put an eight bed unit in place
hey how about you repay me by buyin me one of these cards
yah yah he burst look see ive been payin down on this ted williams card for a couple years now all i need is another twenty two bucks and it mine sweet ted mister did you know he is last guy to hit over 400
well yah of course i do everyone knows that ya little squirt is that why you want the card
no i want the card cuz he is coming back and i want to get him to autograph it for me wouldnt that be something id be rich if i could get his autograph on his card
well yah of course hes all frozen proper like out there in the desert or dessert alcor is the place its only a few miles from my grandparents place googled it anyway ted and his head are just waiting and when he is ready he is coming back and ill be right there when he walks out of the facility flashes blazing like the fourth of july me calm like i will ill be there and ill get him to sign the card so mister can you help me get the card step up man i wont tell your wife about this vi dame
so do you know this rockrock person and what does the photo have to do with this
ya see back in the day i worked a few non commercial stations in new york boston and middle america this guy sounds pretty familiar but the degredation of the tape is muckin with my memory its throwing me off a bit it could have been a very good friend of mine using an alias and the tape warble is weird too ya know the whole alias alternate name thing that is the norm these days with so many folk in the online world was pretty much confined to terrestrial broadcast radio back then of course way back to the dawn of broadcast radio there were stage names and ghost writers but with radio the first mass electronic media fake names or alias were really something different the alive quality the live broadcast nature of the medium coupled with the intimacy of the audio in the ear of the listener really shifted persona frontin to a whole new realm
mr radio historia phila dr ya know could you just answer the question who is this guy
blaaaah ok so do you have any idea wait check that question how about will you be able to figure out who and what and why this recording was dropped here i mean it was literally airmailed and was that an eno track followed by firesign
well if that is me then why dont i remember
coop you had a pretty tough time out in california didnt you
well yah i suppose it was a tough year we flew and jumped a lot and i did hit the trees a few times more than i can ever remember doin in the past i think
well yah i would say that at least four or five times a season someone now not always someone sitting in my seats but someone within a few seats gets hit usually you dont see the blood but usually you dont have someone wearing a white silk top to the game silk really shows off blood
hey if you dont mind me asking braid how often do you sell your seats what you have had those season tickets for twenty or is it 30 years now
actually coop i only sit in my seats if it is the playoffs i sell or give away the seats to every regular season game i clear at least seventy six thousand a year selling the seats
yup it is a bit weahd but hey i actually prefer to stand and mill about during the game more action better people watching
well ya coop i been here a long time paid my dues sat through hundreds of games of sorrow with the sox have paid well maybe not hundreds but tens of thousands for tickets over the years keeping the season tickets in the fold and now well i deserve to make some of it back whilst the pink hats and silk patrons pay the gs for the seats
people watching indeed braid indeed get it while you can

you know where to find me and get rid of that wack snogue gear it cant be good for your rehab
hes been on the lam for four years and we were initially told he fled to mexico
from the information i got he was hiding keeping a very low profile
weve seen evidence for this water ice before in observations by the mars odyssey orbiter and in disappearing chunks observed by phoenix last month but this is the first time martian water has been touched and tasted
phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on mars
were excited because surprises are where discoveries come from one surprise is how the soil is behaving the ice rich layers stick to the scoop when poised in the sun above the deck different from what we expected from all the mars simulation testing weve done that has presented challenges for delivering samples but were finding ways to work with it and were gathering lots of information to help us understand this soil
its a 30 watt light bulb giving us a laser show on mars
the details and patterns we see in the ground show an ice dominated terrain as far as the eye can see
they help us plan measurements were making within reach of the robotic arm and interpret those measurements on a wider scale
ahh you know how it goes just lookin but thanks doll
you know i hear that hundreds of times a day but
she has a yankees tattoo she has a yankees tattoo
ding ding you win that sure is funny way to tell a lady you like her new tattoo
well actually viv i dont like your tattoo nope not one bit well may nah i dont really care for tattoos especially ones located their girlfriend that is just too obvious
oh right i understand your one of them classy joes
what in the hell are you doing with the beyond yesterday primitivistic shite
well big boy gimme a chance and lets find out together
you aint seen but half of it and you clearly
wow i did not think you were going in that direction ever going to ever do that
yah im full of surprises and empty of inhibition hey i never thought youd get that freakish implant either coop so you goin to the game you meeting braid
hell be there he wouldnt miss it i mean hey is cocoa with you coop i been hearing some stuff about a package a blimp some stuff
great thatll be swell then i really need to talk with him
the japanese who show up here actually buy the regular stuff its the college kids that tend to buy the japanese language stuff
but i we will be there no earlier than midnight viv
swell coop your a genius in research well have a real nice or maybe not so nice
morning hopefully youll get to the bottom of this mystery
we are committed to ensuring that the products that come into america are safe for consumers and that the regulating agencies have what they need in order to do their job
we still have a few concerns but not enough that would keep us from signing the bill
so the president will sign that as soon as they can get it to us
i have a responsibility to ensure that our state has enough money to pay its bills this is not an action that i take lightly
i have nothing to eat son i have been sleeping without food for days
hope is the power that gives us the power to step out and try
do you think i ever woke up in the morning surveyed my apartment and said maybe ill crank the tunes and jump on my couch for a while i dont think so
amazing wonderful and in most cases untrue stories about myself
a prototypical child of the electronic age he knows how to use the sound bite he will give you a sentence that will be tailored for you to put into your news broadcast he is a child of the age in that sense
this path im on now is only something i arrived at after having fully explored my own dickiness
why certain undisclosed charities would give money to pay overhead for what is essentially a charitable conduit
williams insists that whenever a person gives money for a particular charity 100 per of that money gets to the named beneficiary that may be true but it does not mitigate the fact that the vast majority of the overall money collected during 2006 went to administration
we charge nothing for donations collected online and even cover the credit card costs associated with each donation we rely on the support of generous donors and advertisers to provide this service
we have a responsibility to scrutinize all charitable endeavours to ensure that we are getting decent value for our dollar
the point of this letter is to emphasize both the general and specific importance of all of us making the effort to sign up so that our organs may be used after our death by others for whom they can be the gift of life and for the extra courageous and hearty there are organ and bodily donations that can happen while we are alive many people wait on lists desperately hoping for this miracle and any of us may find ourselves or a close loved one in need at some point in ourlives the sad fact is that a small fraction of the population has signed up to make such donations possible at least by the laws in bc without that few moments of paperwork our body parts will simply go to the grave or crematorium that follows and sign up asap if you live in another jurisdiction take a few minutes and find out how you can do the same consider forwarding this email to your friends your facebook site your network post on your blog or however you prefer lets create a wave of donors
hey it looks like this package is somehow attached to the dog
this package that you dragged me out to see it has this weird filament attached to it and it is attached to the dog
hey this stringy stuff is really weird its like really super strong and almost feels like silk hey did spiderman drop this package off or something
censorship is anathema to the very spirit of the olympic games which celebrates diversity emphasizes mutual respect and demands dispassionate unadulterated representation of each competition
china had promised to provide media covering the games with the same access and freedoms enjoyed at all other olympic games
the ioc cannot sacrifice the olympic ideals in the name of harmony with its host city
a lot of the money raised by givemeaning ends in my pocket
i have stumbled from one business and personal failure to another
the problem with the bible is that its had too many wikipedia edits
indeed i did young man wow it was a classic really still to this day one of the best comebacks ever
you know i remember watchin the game back in the early summer of 08 and it was just devastating couldnt believe it i was there sittin behind and beside jack and he was just so damn quiet damn quiet and arms folded steaming i mean he was having his usual crackin time at the game but he was beside himself by the time the laker had lost their 24 point lead in the forth quarter lost the lead in their own house their own court jacks own hardwood drinkin bottled water i thought hed pull his barker out and start shootin up the joint
hey uncle ank would you like any coffee or juice this morning
aaah ok doll ill have some of that pomegran night and cranberry
ya pomegran night and cranberry man that ray allen he played the entire game that game and and he had one of the most beautiful smooth as pond ice isolation driving layups at the end of the game to totally empty la just gorgeous the iso started above the three point line so it really looked like hollywood movie type play unfortunately for la they cast the wrong guy to play one on one with in that game ray allen smooth
ok here is your juice ank so coop do you remember the game anks talkin about
well i remember the story celtics come back from a 20 something deficit in la in game four ray allen plays all 48 posey and house have huge contributions pierce and garnet their usual great and strong selves another amazing celtics lakers playoff game
oh come on coop it was not just another amazing playoff game
did you just say you were a competitive yoga fan cocoa
har har you were listening to me hey ank one of coops associated parachuted this package in this mornin and we are just dying to listen to this weird tape that came along with it do you mind
oh right right sorry to have interrupted kids ill take my juice and zilla and go see how the espalier are coming in
i asked as i adjusted the cart in the slot
said cocoa as she opened the silken wrap around her hips and let the sun shine in as we prepared to finally listen
yah i just found it looks kinda interesting and familiar
hey is that marblehead maybe around singing beach or is that
hey i know who and where that picture was taken
that photo you are cradling in your skimpily laced lap is
so coop which associate of yours would parachute a package to you on a sunday
well i know of a lot of people who would fancy the idea but those folks would be more interested in dropping bombs or incendiary devices which i guess could still be inside the package but there is only one person who would fashion a parachute from old radio station banners and drop it a total radio monkey but that person is dead or so i thought
yah lets open that after we get the food on the table i could kill for a plate of our eggs bacon and the asparagus what we have been waiting for for over what has it been two years three to eat from our own patch the package can wait a bit cant it
oh sure coop im not hungry anyway but you do look a bit pale you sure you ok that was quite a fall how is the new leg and ankle holding up
ok so can we now open that package that has been staring at me this whole dang breakfast
so coop is that it just a strange mix of shredded stuff
well that my lovely is a honest to goodness radio cart machine
a cart machine is a specialized auto cue quarter inch tape playing machine commonly used in radio broadcasting through the dawn of computer digital playing mechanisms
woe spock that is quite enough fine i get it so who and why would someone send you this thing
well i was known by some folk to have an uncommon love for the things
ok so coop honey why would someone send you one
just look at this thing it weighs about ten pounds it has real plastic buttons and it smells like a cybernetic dinosaur nice oil i bet this is pure marvelous oil in some ways these machines remind me of my 3g iphone
coop look my power points are getting burnt out here with all the uv today i just need to know if you need any help with anything else im about done hearing about the cart machine as it will be a while until you clue me into what led caused or who did this parachute drop thing you can unravel your package yourself unravel your package hey actually i think your own package may be getting burned out here too your kimono is a bit loose hon
would you look at the heads on this deck they are in good shape i wonder
umm ok why i didnt fall that hard really hey this cart machine is actually attached to a battery powered supply already and here is a cartridge
i do believe this is important that we dont make what is already a crowded and difficult environment for the traveling public and flight attendants
you are trying to legislate courtesy folks and that just doesnt work
it s easy to use and it offers a lot of applications
i can t wait to actually see it in use in the field
the real beauty of it is that the technology has been designed so that anyone who hasn t had any training on it can use it
the government of japan believes that stringent measures taken to relieve the two officers showed a serious stance from the u s side in regards to the fire
the government of japan understands that the navys investigation was conducted professionally and objectively
we are stunned and cant help feeling shivers going down our spines
for local stuff i dont drive as much ill get on a train
ill take the free garrison bus from panzer casern to patch barracks to do grocery shopping
my kids take the bus whenever they need to go to the hub a teen hangout at patch barracks or to a movie
you do quite a bit of driving when you live out here
i havent noticed us cutting down we have a hybrid for our other car and that helps
well never see 2 a gallon again id be happy to see 3
by pricing gas using a market based system were able to be more consistent with gas prices

we will make every effort to ensure the surcharge is the amount required to cover overhead costs nothing more nothing less
and if they thought there was any profit theyd be on us like a ton of bricks
we are purchasing the fuel in euros and the overhead costs often are paid in euros
please take into consideration whilst the price of oil increases the purchasing value of the dollar has decreased 37 percent in five years on our side had the dollar remained as it were five years ago we would be paying 37 percent less
we kept the patient comfortable with high doses of antibiotics and painkillers but medevac was the only option we had for definitive treatment
network comprised of machines under the control of a single user
criminal activity such as spam e mail identity theft denial of service attacks and spreading malware to other machines on the internet
i havent seen any reservations canceled yet that we have made
it is quite a busy time but most of the carriers we use are american carriers anyway
for the temporary duty or transferring travelers hopefully they will be ok when going to the states
maybe later if the strike keeps going it could be worse
years of inaction at the dod continue to speak volumes about senior leaderships commitment to our servicemembers and civil servants
when it comes to sexual assault in the military the dod has absolutely no credibility
even one sexual assault violates the very essence of what it means to be a soldier
i can assure you the army treats this very very seriously
civilians are not afforded the same protections as active duty military personnel after suffering an assault
if i knew then what i know now i cant say for sure i would have reported it
we keep thinking that the dod would get it by now but they dont
were looking at about a 2 billion price tag for relocation and building an entirely new line
if you add more train miles to a route for the railroad youll make trucking more attractive than railroad service so if thats the case youll have more trucks on the roads and people dont want to see that
this was a pretty serious safety issue that we are going to correct
loss of confidence in his ability to command and his failure to meet mission requirements and readiness standards
we found cigarette butts where we shouldnt have found them
the fire and the subsequent magnitude of the fire were the result of a series of human acts that could have been prevented
so nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky thats essentially the argument theyre making
americans want a respectful campaign people say negative ads move numbers they may but do we have to go to the lowest common denominator i dont think so
we need to provide ore to the construction side of the operation to then commission the plant
we shouldve by now already started that process but because of the delay in terms of relocating the power diversion around this property we now are out of kilter with what it is we should be doing in preparation for the mining
it is wonderful to see many grape varieties collecting medals indicating the region can produce wine that is as good as any in australia
i congratulate peter and anne jeffery of spring ridge on their trophy for the best chardonnay of the show which has consolidated cowras position as one of the top chardonnay regions in australia
the best local wine of the show went to a shiraz and silver medals were won by viognier and semillon among the bronze medals we had a merlot cabernet sauvignon chardonnay shiraz shiraz viognier verdelho and a chardonnay semillon blend
bathurst forming a menshed in bathurst is a good idea
we have seen our membership jump from 30 members to 80 and many have formed great friendships
we would like to see the youth come here and we could teach them how to build and create things we are looking to do an outreach course with tafe so people can learn how to use computers and we may have work for the dole people come here as well
you can really see the progression the involvement and desire by the members to help young people is just fantastic and almost seems like a natural thing for groups like menshed to do
we have received several grants and some of that money will be used to purchase new computers
while its hot and dry the water supply level is very solid
most people dont realize the impact cattle has on the state economy
its the largest agricultural industry in the state and right now theres a rise in ranchers who feel they need to cut their losses
he told me he hadnt played offensive line since middle school i tell you what junior guard nick charles and a couple of those older kids have done a good job just kind of crash coursing him
he can move and he can bend and hes aggressive
it gives him a little bit better chance to play
i just dont think you can have a bunch of quarterbacks i think youve got to pick who your top two or three are and those are the guys you need
weve got a lot of young guys so theres going to be a lot of anticipation a lot of guys ready to step up and play
so theres definitely a lot of emotion going around so thats good
this group will have a great work ethic and this group will have a great spirit about it
now what weve got to do is get to the point where we play well
this time last year we had a lot of them that were absolutely clueless because everything was new
just the difference a year makes in the system were light years from where we were terminology wise and mentally
youre able to get into a lot more detail sooner
last year you were just trying to teach them the big picture where at least now theyve got a little bit of a grasp of it and you can be a little more thorough
i want to make sure that were getting guys that you feel like really have a strong chance to be good players here
and i think each guy gets more repetitions each guy gets more teaching each guy gets more coaching
once we do put the bolts on the helmets if a guy hasnt earned them then hell be a bald falcon
the lighthouse and pier reflect and celebrate the long and storied history of lake champlain and the people who lived and worked on its waters and along its shores

ohh its just my mobile i threw on the niks bed
ohh i was about to tell you mom rohan just called me and asked to come to his room he has some new cds
i wonder if it hurts when i throw them at her
i will be there in few more minutes aadi please wait for me
how come you didnt notice me coming this time aadi

i remember when bernard hopkins was challenging me and at that time i was a welterweight and he was fighting as a light heavyweight and he called me out
as a fighter i felt i had to challenge him so i did now manny pacquiao is challenging me and i am definitely considering it
we were watching an espn 2 show a few weeks ago and they mentioned that brian minto amp kevin johnson were two of the top five american heavyweights but eddies name wasnt on the list come on now minto couldnt hit eddie with a handful of rice
i started bernard hopkins and i managed former super middleweight champion steve little and eddie has more natural talent than anyone i have managed
i see guys like ruiz valuev toney amp barrett getting opportunity after opportunity and that shuts out guys like me who lost one fight that i know i could have and should have won
james is a very fan friendly fighter whose body attack alone makes him entertaining every time out his vast wealth of amateur experience provides a solid foundation for him hes the type of fighter who adds value to every card he appears on
i love his body punching when you combine that with his tenacity in the ring it is hard to imagine him ever being in a bad fight
that shows me that james is a real fighter i hope to do lots more fights with him in the future he was willing to get right back on the horse against a guy who is not a pitty pat opponent
james is a very rugged and crowd pleasing fighter he sells a lot of tickets and has a lot of enthusiastic fans he generates excitement
theres no doubt that james can come back and be a world champion someday hes very strong willed and has a ton of guts and determination ill be rooting for him hes a dynamite fighter and a great guy
this time last year i was supposed to be fighting a legitimate ex champ in kassim ouma on a pay per view undercard
that fight got cancelled but this time im in against a more respected ex champ in vernon forrest a future hall of famer and our fight is the co feature so its an even bigger fight
this time around were fighting on my side of the tracks which means ill come with more aggression and more machismo i know vernon will come with more hunger but im a young hungry undefeated champion now and im going to stay that way
he fought a great fight but he fought a vernon forrest who was at 45
i had a bad night that night i had a terrible night the worst of my career it was like i was fighting in quicksand but on sept 13th mora will fight the vernon forrest he expected in june ill be at 100
everyone who faces me says that the truth is that i have a difficult style and they find that out first hand when they fight me
all his style did was make for an ugly stinky fight to watch and it was even more ugly to participate in it takes two to make a good fight and i couldnt give anything to make it a good fight i felt like i stunk out the joint that night
its a misconception that i got old or that i took him lightly
this time ill limit how much ill train for the fight
i could have done more in the first fight because i knew what he was going to do its just that physically i couldnt adapt to what he did after four rounds i had nothing
hes a master at holding without the referee seeing he holds and he tries to headbutt and elbow on his way in he even kneed me in the chest during one clinch thats why i hit him behind the head so i could draw attention from the ref vernon knows every trick in the book
i think its going to be a more exciting fight this time
i see in his eyes that i hurt his pride by beating him
im going to be more aggressive im going to throw more right hands and go to the body im not going to hold back like i did the first time its mexican independence day weekend so i dont mind being a little macho or spilling a little blood
i knew it was going to happen the eventual stoppage of cotto ive sparred with margarito for years sometimes he has good days sometimes i have good days but its always a war with him
i remember the first time i sparred with him was in 1999 in oscar de la hoyas camp for ike quartey
its been our goal to continue to bring exciting las vegas style boxing to this area since the beginning five years ago we have worked tirelessly to entertain the great boxing fans of this area by putting together some of the most exciting fights out there this saturday will be a culmination of all the hard work we have put forth these past five years we are going to pay our respects to the past of one in a million and look towards the future
she knows about it people have told her but she hasnt seen it and she doesnt plan to
shes on tour with benji madden and isnt watching television and has not been on the internet
but shes already said shes not too happy about it
i have fought some rough and tough fighters but hes the dirtiest fighter there is
there was no way he was gonna beat me anyway
i was too smart too fast too experienced if i kept on hitting him i would have killed him

this is not expected to have a negative impact on kyoto performance
the focal point for kyoto questions remains the economy ministry as far as i know that hasnt changed
everybody sees china as this monster polluter but it is doing so much more than that
china is already leading in certain types of technologies in the power sector it is in clean coal solar wind in transport it is developing more efficient compact cars and electric cars
developed countries really need to demonstrate their sincerity demonstrate the feasibility of the solutions really demonstrate that they are serious about this
telling developing countries that they must do it when they themselves are not is just not acceptable
in china the top leadership are all of the same mindset china opened up 30 years ago but our economic miracle was driven by intense resource use that produced great pollution and recently unrest
that is fully understood the leadership has been thinking about a new pathway they know they cant repeat the path of the past they know it has to be clean it has to be more efficient low carbon has now been integrated into this new pathway
china has got the green message companies are making profits in pushing forward the low carbon economy
the thinking in china is that there is no doubt that in 20 or 30 years time china will be a world leader
if you can only have energy when the sun is shining youre in deep trouble and thats why in my opinion photovoltaics havent penetrated the market
if i could provide a storage mechanism then i make energy 24 7 and then we can start talking about solar
i can turn sunlight into a chemical fuel now i can use photovoltaics at night
opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
on the oxygen side it doesnt work well and you have to put way more energy in than needed to get the oxygen out
its cheap its efficient its highly manufacturable its incredibly tolerant of impurity and its from earth abundant stuff
we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
obamas solution to americas energy crisis is inflating tires maybe hes been out of the country too long
running a tire 20 percent underinflated only 5 to 7 pounds per square inch psi can increase fuel consumption by 10 percent that can easily cost motorists two or three miles per gallon not only that but running underinflated also reduces the tires tread life

they thought we were drug dealers and we were treated as such i dont think they really ever considered that we werent
only celebrities like barack obama demand bottles of an organic brew black forest berry honest tea
i do have to ask my opponent is that the best you can come up with is that what is worthy of the american people
you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
he can inspire the country to greatness this tomfoolery needs to stop
because we have research and development expertise and focus on 10 disease states
i dont think wed like to be exclusively biotech but were certainly moving more in that direction
there are an awful lot of biotechs with market capitalizations under 1 billion
we are reviewing it and once weve had a chance to do that well consider whether the decision should be appealed
ill vote for obama because we need a democrat in the white house
the best way that we can stand up for you is to make sure we have a democratic president taking the oath of office on jan 20 2009
seen his passion his determination his grace and his grit
there are a lot of folks still on the sidelines trying to make up their minds
if were going to have a president that respects unions
theres quite a few of us on the fence im not the only one a lot of her supporters are there
right now obama is saying shes low on the list well decide what to do if he doesnt choose her
i was thinking she would win and she slid back and i was really disappointed
i definitely want to see a democrat in the white house
he wasnt my first choice but thats the choice now
she stood strong and tall and im glad shes supporting barack obama
she has integrity and shes a lady of her word
they have to focus on electing a democrat mccain is not union friendly
if youre electing him youre putting bush back in the white house

we didnt have a lot of time to get it done so it tends to move a lot faster the last 24 hours i was surprised they obviously had a need for another bat in their lineup and a need for another outfielder i know white sox gm kenny williams had interest in junior in the past and looked at this as a good opportunity to add him to his club
he thought about it and said he wanted to talk to his family about it i think its a very good opportunity for him they obviously wanted him pursued him and came after him thats got to be a good feeling for him i guess
it was a lot more brief than i thought it was going to be
it was kind of shocking all of sudden bam it was done he is still going to be a friend of mine im upset that hes leaving but its a good situation for him he wants to win a ring the white sox are in first place and he has a chance
he wasnt having his best year but he was just getting hot
you wont be able to fill those shoes no one is ken griffey jr its the end of an era in cincinnati he got hurt a lot but was one of the top five best to ever step on the field
hes one of the best four or five hitters in baseball
i like him yet he marches to his own drummer i had him in the all star game it doesnt make sense to me that he would be available
we had some things that we were looking at that we were trying to improve mainly with the pen and we did that with rhodes
we were trying to add catching depth and we banged on i think every door if we didnt its our fault as far as any other opportunities yes there were other opportunities that we wanted to explore because we like to be active with the minutes ticking we wanted to take advantage of it why some of those things didnt come to fruition could be a number of factors it could be the money the players to somebody else had different goals than we did
we had conversations that went right down to the wire
and whenever you have that obviously you feel like theres a chance but it takes two teams and by definition trades are difficult to make and weve worked extremely hard the last couple of weeks to try and find a pick and improve the team but at the end of the day we didnt find something that lined up for us
i know there was a lot out there the way we view that is that the trade deadline is an opportunity for us to examine ways to improve our club we did that we had a lot of discussions a few of them led right up to the deadline but obviously nothing came to fruition
we exchanged proposals in a couple of instances but nothing to the point were i was calling owner tom hicks for the final signoff
the last four or five days obviously weve been in a lot of discussions and a lot of meetings and talked over a lot of different scenarios
but we were never real close to what i would call making a deal
tell you one thing and behind your back they do another thing
for the first time we may have a highly useful model of postpartum depression
the new research also points to a specific potential new target in the brain for medications to treat this disorder that affects 15 percent of women after they give birth
after giving birth female mice deficient in the suspect protein showed depression like behaviors and neglected their newborn pups
giving a drug that restored the proteins function improved maternal behavior and reduced pup mortality
improper functioning of the delta subunit could impair the gaba systems ability to adapt to hormone fluctuations during the highly vulnerable post partum period
targeting this subunit might be a promising strategy in developing new treatments for postpartum depression

with our catalyst almost 100 percent of the current used for electrolysis goes into making oxygen and hydrogen
though until i hear a confirmation of mits findings from another university respected source i hold on to my severe doubts about this
with our catalyst almost 100 percent of the current used for electrolysis goes into making oxygen and hydrogen
noceras catalyst is made from cobalt phosphate and an electrode that produces oxygen from water by using 90 percent less electricity than current methods which use the costly metal platinum

when i first started with the blackhawks it was in the back of my mind but i kind of set it aside and wanted to go about and get my career in motion
the free agent signings of the blackhawks caught my attention but you also have to develop your own players
i can be another set of eyes for dale and denny and the organization
with the outdoor game against detroit everything kind of goes together
im really looking forward to getting this thing to where it should be
look hes doing well and i have done well in the past
this year was hard i guess with the start of the year but nevertheless i still think its been a good year i just hope i can show it now at the olympics and the u s open
im looking forward for the next two tournaments those are really the ones that can make this season from a good one to a great one again
i already played against him six times and it was always close so i knew that im going to have a chance today
i dont think american tennis is troubled by any means but the way it is right now the best players in the world are from switzerland and spain
to be honest i didnt think that it would happen in this tournament because last week i played really bad
and i was injured before so i didnt do nothing basically for two weeks
its tough to beat a guy like that with a second serve
we believe the case will be solved if we can find this man
even if they arrest me what could they charge me with they have been on a month long fishing expedition and not caught any fish
i dont expect this case to be solved any time soon
with full support from azizah as well as the pas and dap leadership and our friends in permatang pauh i am offering myself as an mp for the constituency
actually selangor menteri besar tan sri khalid ibrahim had offered bandar tun razak so did azmin ali with his gombak seat they are all safe seats including the one in kulim
if it looks very safe please convey that to umno
where hydro power is concerned zambia has a lot of potential as for biofuels there are several types of crops that can be turned into fuel
we have found zambia to have potential it has political stability and leadership that is committed and farsighted it also has a wealth of resources
i believe there is a good opportunity for malaysia to be involved in zambias growth
there are several major projects to be implemented in zambia first of all the government wants to make lusaka a cargo hub it also wants to build an inland port and a transportation corridor linking the country with major ports in africa
there is also the plan for a multi functional trade zone this trade zone will not only have factories but also research and development facilities
the investigation papers have been submitted to the chambers for further action but i do not know the contents
no doubt i am the minister in charge but i am not in the habit of finding out the contents because that is not my job
let the due processes take place under the law anwar is innocent until proven guilty
there should be no talk about charges or him being arrested
the police have completed their investigations and the papers have been submitted
it is up to the chambers to decide whether to press charges against him or not
conducting a trial for the public to make a decision on the case

it wasnt really fair for him ivan that he didnt play in the glass court before this i could see he was struggling in the glass court he was seeing the ball quite slow
furthermore permatang pauh is anwars home base which his wife pkr president datuk seri dr wan azizah wan ismail won even in 2004 at the height of bns popularity
she has failed the rakyat she has proven she is unfit to serve the people
the people can see for themselves our contributions pr has done nothing they have not helped the malays especially those in the rural areas
everyone has been talking about the discussions and their opinions are varied i fear we may go astray from the original objectives of the talks
that is why i think we should let the leaders of both parties hold formal meetings to discuss matters of importance to umno and pas
we could discuss fundamental issues such as religion and leave politics out
such moves would only lead us to lose focus and force us to talk on old issues that have been a hindrance to closer relations between umno and pas
if all is made known then it would become discussions via the media
there is no basis for the state assembly to demand such a thing
what right do they have to ask the federal government to pay them for the projects
this is all just a political ploy by pakatan rakyat
i am disgusted that tony blair has been invited to malaysia this man to me is a war criminal through instigating the war in iraq he has killed more than former bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic and saddam hussein
saddam has been hanged karadzic was recently arrested but this man goes around the world lecturing on the rule of law
it is great to be back here this is my favourite country the people are friendly and very giving with their smiles
it depends on how often we eat out usually its once or twice every weekend
its better to go to regular sellers they recognise you and will keep the prices reasonable
it further alleged that i had sold out and compromised gerakan the terms sold out and compromised the party essentially means that i have betrayed the party and cannot be trusted with the leadership of gerakan
i just dont know how a book that tells the gerakan story can be interpreted as an attempt to defame someone
we fully support anwar and the party will mobilise its machinery to ensure his victory
i was informed about this development much earlier we will support him all the way
i have lost twice i dont think the party will field me again
i am a fighter i will fight for whoever the party fields as a candidate
i have no problems with ezam former anwar ibrahim aide and pkr youth chief ezam mohd nor contesting the seat i think he will be a good candidate
even the performance of the penang government since the elections is an issue
we call it rezeki harimau we sometimes get a good catch or none at all i will spend more on groceries whenever i get siakap seabass or kerapu garoupa in big quantities
we will keep more of these items before the rainy season my wife knows very well when to stock up on groceries
i have to do it as i want my family to have good meals every day
we have gone through hard times when there was no food at home i dont want my children to beg for food from relatives again
theres nothing much to buy except fresh produce and items like milo and condensed milk
it may raise eyebrows but my husband and children sometimes want to try other types of fish particularly selayang and kembong
these types of fish are cheaper compared to stingray siakap and kerapu that my husband catches its better for him to sell the fish as we can get more money
pas rejects any form of cooperation with umno or bari san nasional at state or federal level we will not be forming any government with them this is no longer an issue
there is nothing secretive any more we can have meetings and the party would be notified of the meetings all this while the party had been informed of the meetings
we want uthayakumar to say that the medicine he had with him appeared in the police search list but it was missing in the detention centres list
he had the medicine when he was moved there we are dealing with a mans life
the court is ready to hear it and so is the senior federal counsel but you are giving all sorts of excuses
if you want this man to be either set free or admitted to a hospital you should proceed now if this was a civil court and you didnt follow the case management directions i would have thrown this case out it is a waste of time to file more affidavits
the idea is to put it all into written submissions because there are too many affidavits
as it is the court has been pushed and pressured just to suit lawyers
i admit that i did it but i did not intend to threaten
this is a serious offence you have taken advantage of a familys grief your action has caused them a lot of worry
the court is not here just to give out punishments it is also to teach lessons
he earns an income of rm450 and supports his four school going siblings he is remorseful of his action and will not do it again
he could be thinking that as the former member of parliament there he would still enjoy good support from voters dr wan azizah took over the seat from anwar and she is now giving way to him
we expected him to contest in permatang pauh although previously anwar said he might stand in bandar tun razak or kulim bandar baharu this shows that he has been misleading the people
i do not think permatang pauh is really a safe seat for anwar taking into consideration all the controversies involving him at present
having a by election involves a lot of work at this time we should be focusing on solving the problems faced by the people and not on pursuing ones personal ambitions
they are treating permatang pauh as a family playground where they can simply pass the baton as and how they like
maybe we should identify a new candidate and not someone who had previously contested there and lost what is important is that he or she must be a party member
umno has gone through various challenges i believe that our machinery would be able to fight against anwar
in the march general election the voters did not reject umno totally what we have to do is to convince them as to why they must support umno and barisan nasional
the general election was just held five months ago barisan nasional would give a strong fight this time around as now the prime minister datuk seri abdullah ahmad badawis leadership is more stable
we in mic are also stronger with our continuous rebuilding and we will give our full support to ensure victory
even if anwar wins it will not make any difference as barisan nasional would still continue to rule the country
but when i read these right finger i always carefully consider the good price because i can always get the s ads and the retailers descriptions
ive lost 30 pounds i really like the new me
my weight loss started off modestly but once i invested in the leanology shakes and capsules the weight started to peel off over the next five months i lost 30 pounds and i have managed to keep it off ever since
i went down to 160 pounds i truly feel terrific
i once thought of myself as lean but now felt heavy
ive lost 27 pounds total im really sold on leanology
i began taking leanology in june 2007 and it only took me three months to achieve my desired weight of 145 pounds a loss of 27 pounds i couldnt believe it i had tried many different weight loss programs in the past but they just would stop working after a point and i couldnt lose any more weight with leanology however i could just keep losing weight im really sold on it
if i could describe the new national defense strategy in one word it would be balance
for the foreseeable future winning the long war against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the u s
success in iraq and afghanistan is crucial to winning this conflict but it alone will not bring victory
we cannot lose sight of the implications of fighting a long term episodic multi front and multidimensional conflict more complex and diverse than the cold war
we must display a mastery of irregular warfare comparable to that which we possess in conventional combat
the use of force plays a role yet military efforts to capture or kill terrorists are likely to be subordinate to measures to promote local participation in government and economic programs to spur development as well as efforts to understand and address the grievances that often lie at the heart of insurgencies
we cant afford to make any mistakes because that would jeopardise the entire production
i cant imagine having to work on this project without them kar lai wong and chong
we are certainly looking to this match with great hope
i am very proud and honoured to have won this award which would not have been possible without the support of my parents azman hassan and rozita ibrahim and my coach lan wei of china
im surprised to have won this award as it is my first of this kind but i hope to use this to inspire to win my pet events the uneven bars and balance beam at the asean schools championships
my team and i have been working on super tight schedules since the show started there is hardly any room for us to breathe between each episode
honestly styling is one of the toughest jobs around but it doesnt discriminate they love you and your work because you make them beautiful inside and out its not all about hanging out with celebrities or anything like that
we are working under a lot of constraints and stress i constantly remind my team to keep within the dress code as it would determine the success of the show
the backstage normally transforms into a war zone every week we cut snip and even burn some of the costumes to achieve the perfect look for the contestants two weeks ago jimmy had to burn a corset to de stress the lace and mind you the garment looked good after that
oh my it was so funny as i had the half ready hat perpetually placed on my head while i continued altering it in front of the mirror at home the whole night
the participation of these team from the asia pacific region proves that the universitys aim to go global is producing positive results
the winds were medium to strong 12 18 knots and later in the afternoon the waters got rather rough
we sailed for about an hour and a half then decided to head in to avoid damaging the mast in a capsize but not before some radical downwind surfing
when we got onshore we were advised to lash down our boats as the winds were predicted to get stronger overnight
i have not had any problems with my boat but i may have to wait a couple of days since few people will sail with their racing spars in the strong winds predicted for the next two days
our plan tomorrow today will be dependent on what the weather looks like and i suspect the gym and pool are going to be popular for most of the day
no point trying to be a hero before the battle actually begins
we are not happy at all im not sure if muraleedharans job will still be secure after the council meeting as his position as coach will definitely be discussed
we have less than a year to prepare the players for the junior world cup
if new blood should be injected and coaches be replaced then we will go ahead
however we are disappointed with the 102 former internationals for not speaking to us first
we would have taken them seriously and considered their proposals
however we are not holding any grudges as whats done is done and we must now look ahead
we are aware that several parties have received copies of the petition but as for now we are prepared to work with these players regardless what comes next
i heard they are interested to contribute through the grassroots and we welcome their ideas
i cant comment on the players meeting with sultan azlan shah and mazlan we will just wait and see
all reports regarding the coaches and players performance and also documents on the countrys coaching system since 2006 have been given to jegathesan to review
what we are doing is collaborating with the mssm the idea is good as teachers will be more involved in coaching and umpiring
i would love to race against him but i dont think i would be drawn in the same heat as him
the top swimmers will all be grouped into the seeded championship heats and my times wont get me into those heats
i said that about the world championships in melbourne last year and i dont think it is going to be any different in beijing
it will also be the toughest to make the semis the toughest to make the finals and the toughest to win
whether that results in world records all the time or whether the world records will come in the finals i think were going to have to wait and see what happens
it wont be a two horse race between australia and the united states i mean you look at countries like britain japan the french the south africans they perform very solidly
theyve made changes from going to the semis to the finals to lower medals to gold medals theres a major shift in world swimming
i think it is disappointing that someone comes in there and literally steals one of the most exciting moments of the games

this is a great surprise and i have not heard of this happening before
we are disappointed and frustrated with the broadcast by sbs
its no secret that were not satisfied by how the last five races went
i was particularly disappointed after the series montreal magny cours silverstone in each one of these races i had the possibility to win but because of one thing or another things didnt go the right way and i lost
i never let myself be influenced by tension and i wont start now ive just to keep my focus and continue to give as much as possible race after race thats what ive done every time i was in trouble
its still much too early to make any forecasts for the championship considering that the first three drivers are only seven points apart the positions can change in a single race
and its useless to cry over spilled milk we are looking ahead with eight races to go and at the end well do the maths we just passed the halfway point of the season so its important to always gain points
excluding hockenheim i was always in a position to win and i hope success will come soon
the race at hockenheim was the most difficult moment of the season
i was really frustrated and disappointed that i couldnt find the right balance of the car but now were in a much better position
we had a productive test at jerez especially on the second day the team have done some great work in the development of the f2008 and im confident for hungary
i love the circuit and it is a great city budapest so i am looking forward to it very much and i just hope for another good result
i wasnt really quite sure i wanted to come and the reason i came is because my kids would kill me if i didnt
i was playing so bad that it wasnt even fun
i was looking forward to a wonderful day but ive never made as many bogeys as i have the last three months and its driving me crazy
what almost killed umno in the last elections is not the leaders but the supporters who leech on them to further their own personal interests
if the leadership does not listen to us now i can guarantee we will continue to lose seats in the 13th general election
you would be shocked at how many members and leaders did not go out to vote
during the general election a supreme council member will ask whether weve eaten whether we are tired whether we are okay now they tell us what resolutions we can and cannot adopt
there was this resolution by a branch that wanted all umno ministers wives to wear the tudung
that was not passed as the division felt it was not the partys place to force them to do it
but every resolution passed or adopted will be in the annual general meeting report
if your resolution is not accepted you can still request that it be debated at the division meeting and this request will be put to a vote if you get enough votes from all the divisions at the meeting it will be accepted and debated
these days branch members are professionals and they know the partys history and its constitution if i want to be a delegate to the division they will ask me what im about and whom i support for this or that post
if i do not answer correctly i will not be chosen and the person who best represents their aspirations will be and that delegate will go to the division and have a hand in forming the partys direction
the extremely high subsidies by the us have caused serious damage to cotton farmers in developing countries including those in africa and 150 million in china
we believe that the us is not in a position to discuss with developing countries members cotton tariffs until they eliminate their cotton subsidies
one of the most reactionary farm bills in the history of the us
i come from a country where 300 million people live on us 1 a day and 700 million people live on us 2 a day so it is natural for me and in fact incumbent upon me to see that our agricultural interests are not compromised you dont require rocket science to decide between livelihood security and commercial interests
its unfortunate that in a development round we couldnt agree to an issue of livelihood and security
looking for commercial interests and enhancing prosperity rather than looking for content which reduces poverty
i was living in akita at the time i fitted in almost immediately met numerous great jazz musicians and was blown away by their skills
over here the scene is totally different but it is full of promise
they come not just to be entertained but also to learn about the music
so youd have to know your audience or youd end up disappointing them
i wanted to connect with my listeners and before you knew it japan became home to me

i called him at the hotel when dylan answered the phone i was tongue tied i eventually composed myself and told him of my intention
he told me to drop it off at the reception and offered complimentary tickets for me and my husband it was awesome
im looking forward to this gig because i love performing in acoustic environments where people enjoy music in its purest form
unlike other jazz events this one is free plus they get to enjoy food and drink in a very relaxed atmosphere
there are 11 sunrise condos near the venue so its within walking distance for residents this explains the good response to the event and why it keeps getting better every year
it is terrible to contemplate how few politicians are hanged
my kind of loyalty was loyalty to ones country not to its institutions or its officeholders
once abolish the god and the government becomes the god
a mans admiration for absolute government is proportionate to the contempt he feels for those around him
the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather in a lack of will

it has been an absolute privilege and honour to serve the wonderful people of this electorate for the past 15 years a responsibility i have never taken for granted

at a recent council meeting representatives from surf lifesaving services australia said 51 people were rescued at the beaches over the past few years
how can a council ignore the principles of competitive neutrality and use general revenue to prop up a poorly performing business unit at the expense of an essential service that saves lives
tourism in this area will be seriously affected by councils decision to not protect their beaches just so it can maintain market share in an area where there is a viable non council alternative
ratepayers should not be punished for councils mismanagement of funds and resources
how many more reports findings and data have to be released saying the same thing before governments sit up and listen
councils are at financial breaking point and are struggling to provide the services and facilities their ratepayers need and deserve
rate pegging is a big problem because it hampers councils ability to set rates according to local needs but a low share of federal taxation revenue skyrocketing election costs and population pressures are also contributing
cost shifting is a continuing issue and the state governments recent planning laws are a classic example they mean a bunch of new panels and systems which councils dont support but will have to fund
if the government supports iparts recommendation to remove councils exemption from payroll tax and increase our contribution to state run fire services ratepayers will again lose
while the infrastructure data used by fiscal star needs to be improved to make the findings for each council more reliable and less alarmist the general conclusions are the same as the independent report into the financial sustainability of local government released in 2006 and various other surveys and findings since
the removal of rate pegging and a greater share of federal taxation are part solutions but the state government also needs to stop cost shifting and start supporting local councils and their ratepayers
councils are committed to their communities and are good at providing for them but are fighting with one hand tied behind their backs

since the start of the year vendors have been wary of the potential decrease in demand for mobile phones
that has not stopped vendors from experimenting with and releasing a host of mid range and high end devices with gps touchscreen and multimedia this also goes for hotly contested emerging markets where vendors are introducing phones that offer features in addition to voice telephony reception towards these devices has been warm and as we head into the holiday quarter demand for these and other devices will no doubt increase
smartphones are still seeing growth rates hovering around 40 0 year over year while the rest of the industry is growing at roughly 10 0
however grouping the rest of the handsets into one category is doing the industry no justice the rise of the feature phone has created a battle at the high end of the market with the main difference between smartphone and feature phone being the high level operating system we expect the competition at the high end will help drive growth within the market and help move volume to higher end devices

see what youre dealing with now is karma ha you really are a greek tragedy
the comments on your site really made me feel hopeful and better about the whole situation since i have no experience with cardio stuff
oh because at st davids we dont do heart transplants
well we need to do a heart biopsy and the ones who do that are the doctors who handle transplants
but im also not just going in there until you know the risks so in a transplant patient to do a biopsy of the heart to see if theyre rejecting it isnt a big deal but with you phil the risk is five fold and its by no means a simple little procedure if you want i can go in there and biopsy but when i do that the heart can tear and make a hole which well isnt good see the heart is like steak you know how a flank steak can just tear well essentially im going in there and taking bites out of your heart im telling you all of this because you need to know the risks and some people would rather not have the biopsies theyd rather not know whats going on
because given all you have atrial fibrillation complete stage three heart block and most concerning in all of this a very low velocity and very erratic heart trace something is wrong and very abnormal something bigger is probably going on now usually you have symptoms you come in complaining about your gallbladder or something and we narrow it down to the heart but everything about this situation is well something weve never seen before
if we do the biopsy hopefully well be able to rule out certain heart diseases namely infiltrated cardiomyopothy amyloidosis myocarditis but other things as well the bad thing with doing a biopsy aside from the risks involved with tearing is that sometimes a biopsy yields nothing
is you might not like the results i might tell you that you have something that cannot be cured that even a transplant wont fix and some people dont want that kind of knowledge so they elect not to do the biopsy ill let you two talk it over
stephanie i just have to say it one thing im scared about is that im going to die tomorrow

my jaw dropped when the doctors told me that 41 percent of the female veterans seen there say they were victims of sexual assault while serving in the military
twenty nine percent say they were raped during their military service they spoke of their continued terror feelings of helplessness and downward spirals many of their lives have taken since
women serving in the u s military today are more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire in iraq

occurrences of sexual assault may be exceeding the rates being reported
at the 14 installations where gao administered its survey 103 service members indicated that they had been sexually assaulted within the preceding 12 months of these 52 service members indicated that they did not report the sexual assault
left unchecked these challenges can discourage or prevent some service members from using the programs when needed

o tribunal constitucional pronunciou se pela inconstitucionalidade de v rias normas do decreto que aprovou a revis o do estatuto pol tico administrativo dos a ores nesse sentido irei devolver nos termos da lei o respectivo diploma assembleia da rep blica
devo no entanto comunicar aos portugueses que outras normas me suscitam s rias reservas de natureza pol tico institucional
trata se acima de tudo da norma relativa dissolu o da assembleia legislativa dos a ores que inovando em rela o ao estatuto em vigor e em rela o ao estatuto da madeira restringe o exerc cio das compet ncias pol ticas do presidente da rep blica pondo em causa o equil brio e a configura o de poderes do nosso sistema pol tico previsto na constitui o
em devido tempo alertei v rios dirigentes pol ticos para esta quest o
nos termos da constitui o a assembleia legislativa regional pode ser dissolvida pelo presidente da rep blica ouvidos o conselho de estado e os partidos nela representados
o diploma em causa pretende agora consagrar o dever adicional de o presidente da rep blica ouvir tamb m a assembleia legislativa os seus grupos e representa es parlamentares e o presidente do governo regional
quer isto dizer que o presidente da rep blica estaria sujeito a mais deveres de audi o e consulta no que toca dissolu o da assembleia regional dos a ores do que os previstos para a dissolu o da assembleia da rep blica
no caso da assembleia da rep blica o presidente da rep blica nos termos constitucionais n o precisa de ouvir a assembleia da rep blica nem o primeiro ministro mas no caso da assembleia legislativa dos a ores teria de ouvir a pr pria assembleia legislativa regional e o presidente do governo regional
a audi o aut noma do presidente do governo regional tanto mais incompreens vel quanto ele tem assento no conselho de estado e a ouvido pelo presidente da rep blica
o mesmo se pode dizer relativamente audi o aut noma da assembleia legislativa e dos seus grupos parlamentares porquanto nos termos constitucionais o presidente da rep blica j ouve os partidos nela representados
entendo que perigoso para o princ pio fundamental da separa o e interdepend ncia de poderes que alicer a o nosso sistema pol tico aceitar o precedente que poderia ser invocado no futuro de por lei ordin ria como o caso do estatuto pol tico administrativo dos a ores se vir a impor obriga es e limites s compet ncias dos rg os de soberania que n o sejam expressamente autorizados pela constitui o da rep blica
semelhante pr tica desfiguraria o equil brio de poderes tal como este tem existido e afectaria o normal funcionamento das institui es da rep blica por isso que considero ser meu dever alertar os portugueses
devo igualmente chamar a aten o para um outro ponto conexo com o anterior
no passado dia 10 deste m s foi publicada uma lei da assembleia da rep blica sobre o estatuto do representante da rep blica nas regi es aut nomas no qual se estipula tal como consta da constitui o que o representante nomeado e exonerado pelo presidente da rep blica ouvido o governo
sobre exactamente o mesmo assunto o decreto da assembleia da rep blica que aprova o novo estatuto dos a ores acrescenta a obriga o do presidente da rep blica ouvir tamb m a assembleia legislativa da regi o
n o se questiona a audi o da assembleia regional na pessoa do seu presidente foi isso que fiz no in cio do meu mandato quando nomeei os representantes da rep blica para os a ores e para a madeira pr tica que ali s segui quando desempenhei as fun es de primeiro ministro e que tenciono manter como presidente da rep blica
mas se aquela audi o tiver por objecto o pr prio rg o colegial podem emergir consequ ncias negativas no processo de designa o do representante
por um lado porque pode colocar o presidente da rep blica no centro de um debate parlamentar regional e por outro porque pode fragilizar politicamente o representante da rep blica e dificultar a escolha de uma personalidade com perfil adequado
considero ainda que merecem repondera o outras normas inovadoras constantes do estatuto
por um lado o procedimento de audi o qualificada que pelas vincula es que cria para os rg os de soberania envolvidos restringe os seus poderes de decis o ultrapassando em muito a regulamenta o do simples direito de audi o previsto na constitui o
por outro lado a limita o dos poderes de revis o do estatuto pela assembleia da rep blica s normas que tenham sido objecto da iniciativa da assembleia legislativa a oriana implica restri es excessivas ao poder de iniciativa legislativa superveniente dos deputados do parlamento nacional
face incerteza que caracteriza os tempos modernos a possibilidade de petrifica o de normas jur dicas constantes do estatuto ao ponto de eternizar a sua vig ncia deve ser examinada com todo o cuidado
a altera o do estatuto pol tico administrativo dos a ores visa concretizar o modelo avan ado de autonomia resultante da revis o constitucional de 2004 mas indispens vel que essa altera o se harmonize com a separa o de poderes e as compet ncias dos rg os de soberania consagrados na constitui o da rep blica portuguesa
temperatures by and large over the summer have been near normal with no real extremes
we had kind of a cool may and a warmer april but nothing unusual
this year the jet stream has been right over us which is why weve been so stormy
because weve been so stormy its kind of kept us out of the heat the forecast for the next two days takes us up into the lower 90s when we get into that warmer weather thats an indication that stream has moved to the north
first you can get dehydration which can turn into heat exhaustion and eventually can be heat stroke
its a spectrum you go from one to the other
you want to drink at a comfortable pace where you dont get sick from drinking and you stay hydrated
the mantra this year is celebrate remember and fight back
celebrating our survivors remembering those we lost and fighting back against cancer

i heard i lost so much blood that there was hardly any blood left to bleed
it is one of australias iconic brands but the bottom line is that the rsl brand is slowly disappearing and sub branches are losing their homes as they either close or amalgamate
a club in bourke has just gone into administration and the areas veteran welfare activities come under threat as you start to lose those threads in those towns
in a country town if you lose an rsl club the anzac day activities that occur there disappear in a time where we have seen a resurgence in those activities
the way he killed her and chopped up the body shows a terrible cruelty he killed her chopped her up and threw part of her body into the river
he started to beat her and she went to live with a friend
he is unemployed but he lives well hes always going to parties in the city
we can confirm the death of a british national in goiania brazil the body was discovered early on july 29
next of kin have been informed and we are providing consular assistance to the family brazilian police are investigating
there are around 41 fewer first time buyers now than at the same time last year
the nationwide data indicate that there is ongoing major downward pressure on house prices from extremely weak market activity stretched buyer affordability and tight lending conditions it seems odds on that house prices will continue to head rapidly south given that the bank of england reported extremely low mortgage approvals for house purchases in june while latest survey evidence shows that house sales are depressed buyer interest is weak it is taking longer to sell a house and sellers are achieving a falling percentage of their asking price
its clear that gordon brown failed to prepare our economy during his 10 years at the treasury and now hard pressed families are paying the price
this correction in house prices is happening because the government allowed the market to get hopelessly out of control
interest rate cuts are clearly not on the agenda in the near term
which would clearly be very bad news for the housing market
affected by this regrettable situation in particular to those who had received an inaccurate diagnosis
i can confirm that 17 patients were initially informed incorrectly that they did not have a malignancy such as cancer however we must emphasise that a number of these patients would have undergone precautionary treatment anyway or been subject to ongoing clinical review
furthermore we can now give absolute assurance that all patients are now following the correct course of treatment
our highest priority throughout has been the care and wellbeing of our patients and we have acted as quickly as possible to make sure that the review was carried out thoroughly and effectively
the patients involved have generally appreciated the efforts we have made to investigate this situation and to recheck individually their samples diagnosis and treatment and i thank them all for their patience and understanding no patients that we have been able to identify have died as a result of a misdiagnosis
where necessary those patients have had their treatment amended we would like to reassure patients that individual details will not be made public
clearly everyone affected will be concerned that not having received the appropriate treatment at the appropriate time has adversely affected their chances of recovery or worsened their prognosis
this is not the first time that a large group of people have been harmed by what appears to have involved the poor judgment of a histopathologist which is why a careful multi disciplinary approach to diagnosis and assessment of treatment modality is so important
an episode such as this demands an independent inquiry into what went wrong so that lessons can be learned across the health service
the spiritual leadership of a global communion of independent and autonomous provinces should not be reduced to one man appointed by a secular government
unless we reach some kind of resolution in the next 48 hours this whole thing will have been an expensive waste of time
the devil may be in the detail of the implementation report to be published in the autumn
lack of commitment from nhs management at all levels has impeded progress in implementing informatics support for patient care
if we were to criticise it would be that there is little recognition or emphasis on building from experience as a profession we have extensive experience on the issues and problems of health informatics we hope this will be used too much emphasis on central development sometimes ignores this fund of knowledge
ticket sales have been brisk and our inventory is dwindling by the day
we are ahead of last years sales at this point and are on pace to rival our record for season ticket sales 24 300 in 2001 weve already sold our third most in a year
there are matters which have arisen which would have caused anybody very considerable concern
the evidence has demonstrated that the practice of beasting which clearly falls outside appropriate military discipline was going on in these barracks openly and must have been known to senior officers
many will have found it unpalatable that the order from captain davis to bring this man to them hot and sweaty was an order that the defendants found themselves having to comply with this sort of activity should not be condoned and mustnt be allowed to happen again and this lesson must be clearly relayed to those in charge
the conclusion of the trial allows the royal military police now to conduct a full investigation into his death
this will examine whether there were any breaches of military law a decision can then be made on further action i am unable to comment until this investigation concludes
left no stone unturned in their effort to establish the full circumstances
we are devastated with the outcome of the verdicts today we have come this far we owe it to gavin that nobody elses child goes through what happened to gavin
we have all been hung out to dry its been really stressful i feel great sympathy for gavin williams family beasting is happening all the time the army should address it

this combination of massive profits and eye watering price rises proves that the privatised provision of basic utilities has failed the public
they should be taken back into some form of ownership by the community
these latest vast profits now put the case for a windfall tax on big oil companies beyond argument
the government should grasp the nettle and do what it did in 1997 by taxing grotesque profits and put the proceeds into helping the millions of people struggling with their fuel bills

i dont want to go into too much detail but it will be a completely new approach
sadie and jemima relish the opportunity to be fully hands on again both designers are working on their next collection
the club has sought clarification from the fa as to why this decision has been reached now given the incident occurred nearly 15 months ago
as we said yesterday we agree with david that the whole party should pull together take the fight to the tories and focus on dealing with the real issues affecting peoples lives
